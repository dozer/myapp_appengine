myapp_appengine
===============

Learning about AppEngine by completing the tutorial on how to deploy Go web apps from:
https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/go/gettingstarted/introduction

The end result should be identical to the last step of the tutorial except I added the user login back in. (Not sure if its a bug that it was removed from the last step of the tutorial but it makes sense for it to be there).
